## Description

This is an Android app for the IoT 2018/2019 course final project and it is based on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and [Nucleo-64 STM32F401 board](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-mpu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-mpu-eval-tools/stm32-nucleo-boards/nucleo-f401re.html). The idea is to make it easier to find a public and secure place where you can leave your belongings in order to go running in total freedom and also to find other people near you with your same interests.

## Installation

In order to install FitBox on your android smartphone you can simply install the .apk file placed in our git repository. During the installation you would be asked from the Google Play Protect service if you want to continue with the installation (this is because our application is not published on the Play Store).
