## Description

This is an Android app for the IoT 2018/2019 course final project and it is based on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and [Nucleo-64 STM32F401 board](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-mpu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-mpu-eval-tools/stm32-nucleo-boards/nucleo-f401re.html). The idea is to make it easier to find a public and secure place where you can leave your belongings in order to go running in total freedom and also to find other people near you with your same interests.
